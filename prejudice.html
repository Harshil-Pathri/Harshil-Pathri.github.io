									<p style = "font-size: 30px">In the 21st century, the term, prejudice, is often associated with racism, sexism, etc. In my times, however, the term prejudice refers to having a fixed mindset about someone based on your previous interactions with them.</p>

												<h3>My Conflict with Prejudice</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">Despite my attempts to avoid prejudice, I have recently learned that I do sometimes create a bias against certain people based on my first impression of them. Most significantly, I had quite a large grudge against my now fiancé, Mr. Darcy. It all started at the party when my mother took my sisters and I to Mr. Bingley’s first party. When Mr. Bingley asked Darcy to dance with me, Mr. Darcy lamented that I was simply “... tolerable, but not handsome enough to tempt [him]” (Austen 9). This first negative comment initiated my sour view of him as an excessively prideful individual. This bias led me to believe a false story about Darcy that I was told by Mr. Wickham, further antagonizing my opinion of Mr. Darcy. The most anger was caused, however, when I discovered that Mr. Darcy had purposefully separated Mr. Bingley and my dear sister, Jane. </p>

										<div class="inner">
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">When Mr. Darcy first confessed his love to me, I was quite shocked to say the least. In the heat of the moment, I voiced my reasons for my dislike of him. The next day, he gave me a letter that gave me a detailed description explaining why he had made certain choices and told me the true story about Wickham. I am quite ashamed of myself to have become a fool, victim to Wickham’s amiable countenance. Soon after I read this letter, I realized how largely I had misjudged Mr. Darcy, and for this reason, I no longer held any disregard for him when he proposed to me for a second time. This goes to show the harmful effects that a bad first impression can have on a relationship.</p>
