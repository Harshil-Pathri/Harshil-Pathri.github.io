												<h3>My Father</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">My father, Mr. Bennet, is very smart and is quite abnormal in that he does not often follow the social norm. In terms of his personality, he is "...a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic humour, reserve, and caprice" (Austen 3). I am much closer to my father than my mother, and I believe it is fair to say that I am the favorite of his daughters. </p>

												<h3>My Mother</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">On the other hand, my mother, Mrs. Bennet, is very social and gossips with everyone about everything. She is "... a woman of mean understanding, little information, and uncertain temper ... [and the] business of her life [is] to get her daughters married" (Austen 3). While I understand that her intentions are good, I find my mother’s preoccupation with marriage quite extreme and overbearing.</p>

											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">Jane is possibly the largest blessing that my family and I have ever recieved. She is the most kind and amiable soul I have ever known, and she can see goodness in everyone. She is very beautiful and is engaged to Mr. Bingley, a very well deserving and rich individual. Out of all of my sisters, I am most intimate with Jane, and we discuss everything with each other.</p>

												<h3>Mary</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">Mary is probably the most studious out of all of us and loves to read. She was described as the "most accomplished girl in the neighborhood" (Austen 9). However, her character and plain looks unfortunately lead her to be considered the most boring out of my siblings.</p>

												<h3>Catherine (Kitty)</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">Catherine — or Kitty as we more commonly call her within my family — was once a very shallow girl, like Lydia. She would follow Lydia and practically worshiped her. Thankfully, after Lydia’s elopement, Catherine changed for the better and no longer has the same obsessions that she once had.</p>

												<h3>Lydia</h3>
											</header>
											<p style = "font-size: 30px">Lydia is a very frivolous girl who has a large fascination with officers, and has been attracted to them her entire life. In fact, she ran away with Mr. Wickham, even though Wickham had shown minimal signs of affection towards Lydia, and he had a quite bad financial situation. Despite my well wishes for Lydia, I worry that she has made a mistake that she may regret.</p>
